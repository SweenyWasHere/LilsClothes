# LilsClothes

This simple website is here to provide an easy way to download the list of clothes for consignment.  There are 97+ pieces in all.

That means there are slightly more than 97 pictures.  Because picture files are pretty large that's a lot to download.  So, I took all of the pictures and loaded them - one per slide - into a Microsoft PowerPoint slide presentation.
There are about 97 pieces.  (There are a few more that didn’t make this list).

All of them are clean.  I washed a bunch, some twice.  The PowerPoint allows you to see every piece quickly.  I also broke them down into categories, so you can see every one of each piece in a category.  There is one category called White Shirts where the quality is "Meh".

All of the other clothing is in very good quality in close to new condition.  But you'll be able to see that from the pictures and I will be happy to bring them to you.

They are all mature women's clothes, and I will sell them either in bulk or on consignment, whichever makes the most sense.  I just want a fair price considering that they are in very good condition.  I also understand that there's a difference in retail price for used clothes vs. new.

Because there are so many pictures, my PPT file was pretty large.  So, I broke it into three files: 
Sweeny_Clothing_List_1_of_3
Sweeny_Clothing_List_2_of_3
Sweeny_Clothing_List_3_of_3

I saved the files onto this web page in two formats, PowerPoint and Adobe Acrobat.  The PowerPoint might be a little easier to work with, but Acrobat files work on every device.

If you're on this website, then I emailed you.  So, please feel free to respond to me by email, text or voice call.

This is the Breakdown of the clothes by category in the files:

Thanks for coming to my web site.

Each of the three files are about 20 MB, so they're a little too large to email, but it's easy to download them.

If you have any problem with this web page, feel free to call me ANYTIME.  It doesn't have to be during work hours!

Thanks, 
Rich
